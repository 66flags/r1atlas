# r1delta

it dont work yet

shit thats broken:
- sendtables
- pebbles
- broomstick handle
- simple ibasefilesystem vftable (17 funcs)
- convars
- concommands
- scripts

# dev setup

1. rename "tier0.dll" to "tier0_r1.dll" in bin\x64_retail\
2. acquire OldTFOScripts.7z from [#1](https://github.com/r1delta/r1delta/issues/1) (you just need bin)
3. copy "gbclient.dll", "nmcogame64.dll" from there to bin\x64_retail\
4. copy "tier0_orig.dll", "server.dll", and "engine_r1o.dll" in this repo to bin\x64_retail\ 
5. build
6. pray (if you're not in the visual studio debug configuration, you need to specify -listenServer as a command line arg to load the listen server)
(a fork of SpectreLauncher by @barnabwhy has been provided for debugging convenience)
